### I2C protocol

I2C (pronounced i squared c or i two c) is a serial computer bus
and data communication protocol, invented by Philips Semiconductor.

It's typically used for attaching low-speed peripheral Integrated Circuits
to processors and microcontrollers in short-distances, such as intra-board communication.

The phillips I2C protocol defines the concept of master and slave devices.
A master device is one that is in charge of the bus at the present time
and controls the clock and generates START and STOP signals.
Slaves simply listen to the bus and act on controls and data that they are sent.

The master can send data to a slave or receive data from a slave - slaves
do not transfer data between themselves.

The I2C interface uses two bi-directional lines, i.e. either device could "drive" either line.
these lines are SDA for data, and SCL for clock.


I2C basic command sequence (master writes to slave)

01. Send the START bit (S). (done by master)
02. Send the slave address (ADDR). (done by master)
03. Send the Write(W)-0 bit. (done by master)
04. Wait for an acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
05. Send acknowledge bit (A). (done by slave)
06. Receive an acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
07. Send the data byte (8 bits) (DATA). (done by master)
08. Send acknowledge bit (A). (done by slave)
09. Receive an acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
10. Send the STOP bit (P).

I2C basic command sequence (master reads from slave)

01. Send the START bit (S). (done by master)
02. Send the slave address (ADDR). (done by master)
03. Send the Read(R)-1 bit. (done by master)
04. Wait for an acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
05. Send acknowledge bit (A). (done by slave)
06. Receive an acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
07. Receive the data byte (8 bits) (DATA). (done by master)
08. Send acknowledge bit (A). (done by master)
09. Receive an acknowledge bit (A). (done by slave)
10. Send the STOP bit (P).

In both cases, steps 7 through 9 can be repeated n times before master sends the stop bit (P).

The acknowledge bit (A) means that the data transfer was successful, so if it's not received,
the device that sent the data can try to send it again.

The Start bit (S) can only be generated by a master device, and it means that SCL is in a logic one
and that SDA is falling from a logic one (or is in a "falling edge")

The Stop bit (P) can only be generated by a master device, and it means that SCL is in a logic one
and that SDA is rising from a logic zero (or is in a "rising edge")

When a slave receives a start bit (S) it resets its internal bus logic.

A slow slave device may need to stop the bus while it gathers data.
It can do this by holding the clock line (SCL) low ,forcing
the master into a wait state. The master must then wait until SCL is released
before proceeding. This can be done because the lines are "open drain"
i.e. if one device holds a line low, the other cannot try to put it into high.

The I2C standard is very attractive to manufacturers, because of its simplicity and ease of use
but requires royalties, so some
manufacturers say that their devices "use a 2 wire interface", and thus avoid
explicitly using the term I2C and having to pay royalties.

I2C may be used with VGA, DVI and HDMI ports, because they are a superset of the I2C
connectionts pinout, i.e. they include an SDA, SCL, ground (GND) and +5VDC pins, all
the necessary pins/connection lines for I2C communication.
